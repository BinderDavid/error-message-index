# Error Message Flashcards

These flash cards are a promotional tool to get more people involved in contributing error messages.
We can prepare these index cards with undocumented error messages and bring them to events such as Zurihac
so that people can "adopt" an error message.

You can build the index cards by invoking `latexmk`.
